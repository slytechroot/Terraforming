Make sure to replace the placeholder values like "your-aws-region", "ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", and "your-instance-type" with your specific AWS region, Windows Server 2019 AMI ID, and the desired instance type.
You can customize the CPU core count, memory size, and disk size by changing the values of the cpu_count, memory_size, and disk_size variables.
To apply the configuration, run the following commands:

terraform init
terraform apply
Remember to have your AWS credentials configured properly on your machine. This script is a basic starting point, and you can extend it with additional configurations as needed for your specific use case.

provider "aws" {
  region = "your-aws-region"
}

resource "aws_instance" "windows_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"  # Windows Server 2019 AMI ID
  instance_type = "your-instance-type"     # Choose an appropriate instance type

  // Customize the instance options
  cpu_core_count = var.cpu_count
  memory_size    = var.memory_size

  root_block_device {
    volume_size = var.disk_size
  }

  // Add more configuration as needed

  tags = {
    Name = "WindowsServer2019Instance"
    // Add more tags as needed
  }
}

// Define variables
variable "cpu_count" {
  description = "Number of CPU cores for the instance"
  type        = number
  default     = 2  # Change as needed
}

variable "memory_size" {
  description = "Memory size in MiB for the instance"
  type        = number
  default     = 4096  # Change as needed
}

variable "disk_size" {
  description = "Root volume size in GiB"
  type        = number
  default     = 50  # Change as needed
}
